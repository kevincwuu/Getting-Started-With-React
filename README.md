# React-Go-Slack-Client-App
Learning by building an IRC app:  using React, Go, and RethinkDB.

### Reactjs
- Components : `React.Component` the bare minimum is to call render(), which is the logic of how the component should be viewed visually and respond to events.
- Properties : offer a way to pass information to components. Use properties to communicate beyond an individual component, which can be bi-directional.
- Event Listener : ex. onClick = {this.onClick.bind(this)}
